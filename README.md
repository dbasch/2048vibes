# 2048 Vibes 🎮

A modern, responsive implementation of the classic 2048 game, built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project was created as an experiment in "vibecoding" - a collaborative development approach where an AI assistant (Claude) wrote the code under human supervision and guidance, focusing on creating a smooth, enjoyable user experience.

## 🌟 What is Vibecoding?

Vibecoding is a novel approach to software development where an AI assistant writes code under human supervision, focusing on the overall "vibe" and user experience of the application. In this project, Diego Basch provided guidance and direction while Claude (the AI) implemented the code, resulting in a polished, production-ready game that maintains the fun essence of the original 2048 while adding modern touches.

## 🎮 Features

- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Touch support for mobile devices
- Customizable grid size (4x4 to 8x8)
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS styling
- Keyboard and touch controls

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- React 18
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Touch events for mobile support

## 🚀 Development Process

This project was developed through a unique collaboration between Diego Basch and Claude (an AI assistant). The entire codebase was written by Claude under Diego's supervision and guidance, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted development in creating production-ready applications.

The development process focused on:
- Clean, maintainable code
- Responsive design principles
- Modern React patterns and best practices
- Smooth user experience
- Performance optimization

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Use arrow keys (desktop) or swipe (mobile) to move tiles
2. Tiles with the same number merge when they collide
3. After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears
4. Try to reach the 2048 tile!
5. Game ends when no more moves are possible
